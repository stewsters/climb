Climb
======

A bit like Crawl, but with more height.


My tools:
+ Java7
+ Groovy 2.1.6
+ SquidLib 1.95 ( https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib)
+ Intellij

Compile
=======
To compile from source you will need Java 7 and to install groovy and gradle.  I recommend using http://gvmtool.net/ for that.
Once you are set up, it will be something like:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/stewsters/climb.git

cd climb

gradle run
```

Controls
========
```
Movement: numpad, vi keys, or arrow keys(if you don't like diagonal movement)

climb down: <
climb up: >

Melee: Bump into enemies

```



Binary Download
========
To run this, I eventually plan to make some jars that you can run with

```bash
java -jar climb-1.0.jar
```

(or double click on it in Windows)

But im not there yet.
